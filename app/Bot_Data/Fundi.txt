üìö Project Overview: Construction Assistant Bot ("FundiGpt")

This project focuses on creating a conversational assistant to help individuals across Tanzania (and beyond) learn about construction processes, materials, and best practices. The bot is designed to assist both first-time builders and those expanding their construction knowledge, offering real-time support across all stages of a building project.

By providing quick, accurate, and contextual information, the bot will improve decision-making, reduce common mistakes during construction, and empower users to manage their building projects more confidently.
üõ†Ô∏è Key Features of the Bot

The bot will handle:

    Guidance on different construction phases (planning, foundation, walls, roofing, finishing).

    Recommendations on material selection based on budget and building type.

    Understanding building permits and legal requirements (optional feature).

    Estimating quantities of materials needed.

    Advice on choosing and managing construction workers or contractors.

Apart from these, the bot will also answer normal user queries related to building and materials.
Below is a detailed breakdown of the system data and functionalities the bot can provide.
